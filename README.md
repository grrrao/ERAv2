# ERA v2 Session 5 Assignment

## Model.py file

This file contains to core NN model running the convolutions:
* block 7: the structure of the neural network. 
* block 9: Train the model, run prediction, loss, and backpropagation, and  test to check loss values. 



## Utils.py file

Just one code block here:
* block 11: plot the loss and accuracy values for training and testing. 


## S5.ipynb file

This is the notebook file that contains the blocks to import and run:
* block 3: preparing the data and normalizing it. 
* block 4: choosing the training and testing datasets.
* block 5: setting the batch size and loading the datasets. 
* block 6: exploring the dataset.
* block 8: plotting accuracy and loss graphs. 
* block 10: Run the model and gradient for 20 epochs.
